Introduction:

My name is Sharique Khatri, I am currently a student at Pennsylvania State University and studying Computer Science. Over the years I have lived in may places but I was born in Mumbai, India on 11th of December 2004. The first ever school experience that I got was my nursery very close to my house the name of that place was Fun and Frolic. I have always been someone who loves to learn and carry my fun and enjoyment alongside my study. I was in touch with all my nursery teachers till I stayed in India. My next experience in terms of Academia was my first Primary School named Don Bosco High School. Only a year back when I was in my nursery I used to love to go to school but when it cam to my Primary school i hated it I used to puke almost every single day. I hated going to school. Then soon I started to make friends and it was not so bad after a few months. But when I was in my third grade one of the most horrific incident happened with me a child. A teacher hit me. After which I in no way wanted to go back to that place. Soon that grade passed and I was in my fourth grade and I met the bet teacher who I am still in touch with after 15 year, my community skills are good. 

This year was the first time I was given the taste of Leadership. i was made the class monitor this kind of recognition made me confident and thus began a journey striving for excellence. 

In my next year in the 5th grade I was again made the monitor because of my confidence, academics and my strong urge to help and grow with the people around me. And in my last year at Don Bosco which was the 6th grade I was bade the Green house vice-captain. This was not only a class-wide recognition but a grade wide. 

I then shifted to Dubai my first ever International transfer. I started going to a school named GEMS New Millennium School. This is where I made my lifelong friends that I know will be by myside. In 7th grade since I was new to the Country and City I knew no one thus school became the only place to make new friends for me. Next year in my 8th grade I was made the Class Prefect seeing my holistic development over just one year. When I came to Dubai my English was pretty bad and was not able to communicate in a desired way but that changed in my 8th grade. Then in my 9th grade I started to explore other options where I could grow. I turned to MUN's (Model United Nations) where I received an award for the runner-up speaker. Then next year in my 10th grade I was awarded with a academic achievement of the highest marks in Math. This is when I realized that Computer Science is what I want to do and not just computer science but be someone who is good at coding, speaking and most importantly communicating. I was also made the Red-house captain

In 11th grade I took my work to a whole different stage. I created a Voice-Contolled wheelchair using Arduino for the actual motor and an App using python that can be used to control the motors speed and the direction in which it is moving. It was a great success after winning our intra school round we were selected to go to the EXPO 2020 to present our product to the world. I was also given the award for the highest marks in Computer Science

In my 12th grade I became the knowledge hour head of communication. My job was to talk to influencers and well known personalities and invite them to our school to have a conversation about career with students. That year was a success in terms of our career development at school

Academic Background
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, where you’ve maintained a 3.6 GPA and plan to graduate in May 2026. During your time at Penn State, you have built a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and software development methodologies.
